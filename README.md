<h1>Face Mask Detection Using OpenCV</h1>
<p>Since it's a COVID-19 Pandemic era , it has become mandatory for everyone to wear Mask.</p>
<p>So in this view I have designed a Face Mask Detector using OpenCV</p>
<p>This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area. So, to take care of this problem we donâ€™t need any guard or person who keeps a watch on people. We can integrate a camera which continuously clicks pictures of humans and detect from there faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not.</p>
